System1:
(1)	Description
This is a surface-initiated polymerization system which is introduced in "Hong Liu,You-Liang Zhu, Jing Zhang, Zhong-Yuan Lu and Zhao-Yan Sun, ACS Macro Lett. 2012, 1, 1249".
With this model, the molecular weight and its distribution, as well as the polydispersity index of the grafted chains, can be investigated.
(2)	system
The radius of the ball is 25 (in reduced unit). The chain will grow by polymerization from the inner surface of the ball.
(3)	Commands
	1)	Run the simulation by :
		python ballsip.molg
		python ballsip.gala --gpu=0 >a.log&
	
	2)	See the configuration by:
		vmd filename.mol2
		Ovito filename.xml
