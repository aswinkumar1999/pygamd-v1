(1)	Description 
The comb-like copolymer A6 (B2)3 in solution will form a vesicle in DPD simulation. 
The system is described in “Ying-Tao Liu, Ying Zhao, Hong Liu, Yu-Hua Liu, and Zhong-Yuan Lu, 
J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 15256–15262”.

(2)	System
The system consists of 1280 A6 (B2)3 and 176640 S with box size of 40*40*40. The concentration of the block copolymers is 0.08. The parameters for DPD simulation are listed:
alpha	A	B	S
A	    25	70	150
B		28	27
S			25

(3)	Commands
1)	Run the simulation by:
    python comblike.molg
	
    python comblike.gala --gpu=0>a.log&


2)	The PBC conditions can be removed by:
    galaTackle filename.xml 
Select the function of 9 and enter; a new “filename. reimage.xml” will be generated.
And then you can see the configuration by OVITO
