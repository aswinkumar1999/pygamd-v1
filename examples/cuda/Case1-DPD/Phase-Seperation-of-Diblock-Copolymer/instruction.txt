1. Description 
These three systems are diblock copolymers with different ratio of block length. 
They will form a microphase separated structure in DPD simulations. 
They are described in reference “Robert D. Groot and Timothy J. Madden, 
Dynamic simulation of diblock copolymer microphase separation, J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 108, No. 20, 22 May 1998”.

2. Systems
Description	No. particles	ρ	f	  α_ii	α_AB	χN	Time	Phase
A1B9/A2B8	24000	        3	0.14	25	57	    98	80000	bcc
A3B7	    24000	        3	0.30	25	40	    46	40000	hexagonal
A5B5	    24000	        3	0.50	25	40	    46	40000	lamellar

3. Commands
1) Generate the initial configuration of “.xml” file by:
   python A5B5.molg.

2) Run the simulation by:
   python A5B5.gala --gpu=0>a.log&

3) The PBC conditions can be removed by:
   galaTackle filename.xml
Select the function of 9 and enter, a new “filename.reimage.xml” will be generated.

4) See configuration by OVITO
